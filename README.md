# Adverse Weather Classification System

A comprehensive deep learning solution for weather condition classification designed to enhance autonomous vehicle navigation and safety in diverse weather conditions.

## Overview

This project implements an intelligent weather classification system using advanced computer vision and deep learning techniques. The system classifies weather conditions into 7 categories: **Cloudy**, **Rainy**, **Snow**, **Sand/Dusty**, **Shine/Sunny**, **Sunrise**, and **Fog**.

## Project Structure

### üî¨ Preprocessing & Training (`preprocessing_and_training/`)

#### Data Processing Pipeline
- **`combine_data.py`**: Automated data organization script that consolidates weather datasets from multiple sources and restructures them into class-specific folders
- **`data-preprocessing-and-modelling.ipynb`**: Main preprocessing pipeline implementing:
  - Image resizing and normalization (224√ó224√ó3)
  - Data augmentation (rotation, cropping, horizontal flipping)
  - Train/validation/test split (80/20 division with further 20% validation split)
  - Label encoding for 7 weather classes

#### Advanced Data Processing
- **`advanced-data-processing.ipynb`**: Implements sophisticated preprocessing techniques:
  - **PCA Dimensionality Reduction**: Color channel-wise PCA with 100 components achieving ~90% variance retention
  - **Image Reconstruction Quality Analysis**: Using VIF (Visual Information Fidelity) metrics
  - **Convolution Filtering**: Custom kernels for blur, sharpening, edge detection (Sobel, Laplacian)
  - **Feature Extraction**: ResNet-50 based feature extraction with t-SNE visualization

#### Model Architecture & Training
- **Transfer Learning Implementation**:
  - **EfficientNet-B0**: Achieved 91.5% test accuracy
  - **ResNet-50**: Achieved 91.9% test accuracy
